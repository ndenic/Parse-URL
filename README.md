# Parse URL - Code Challenge 

You want to hack a website now. First, get all the available parameters that you can find in the URL. Then print them in the "key : value" format. If a parameter doesn't have value, print "not found".

If you find the password (parameter pass), you should print its value after all parameters once again, but with a key password. If a URL does not contain parameter pass, do not print anything after the listed parameters. However, if pass parameter is present, its value cannot be empty.

Note: the order of parameters should be the same as in the URL.
Advice: Check examples for better understanding and carefully learn the structure of the URL.

Sample Input 1:

https://target.com/index.html?pass=12345&port=8080&cookie=&host=localhost
